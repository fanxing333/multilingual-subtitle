1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Is that sufficient?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But you do have certain predispositions that you're giving in the same way in which people from political correctness are trying to say,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
this is what it means to be a woman, these are the kind of things that it is expected from a woman to do to defend herself.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And it seems to me that you are making a similar claim about, this is what conservative people do, and this is how they always relate to hierarchy.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, I would say that I perhaps am doing that, but I don't see how that's the same as what the postmodernists are doing.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I mean, as far as I can tell, the postmodernists aren't saying that the groups, the individuals within those groups,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
are characterized by any stable characteristics whatsoever, except for the fact of their comparative oppression.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So I don't understand the first part of your argument.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I mean, part of the reason the postmodern types have been going after me is because I've dared to say that men and women differ in temperament.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Which, by the way, they do.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, you know, that's actually something that might be worth just differentiating quickly,

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
because it's actually technically somewhat challenging, but also very much worth knowing.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was debating someone on a panel this morning on a TV show, The Right Stuff,

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and this was a woman who led the women's equality party,

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and she cited some psychological literature that purported to claim that men and women were mostly the same.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And that's actually true.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We are more the same than different.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If you look at our temperaments, there's more overlap than there is variance by a substantial amount.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And so even on the temperamental dimensions where there is most difference between men and women,

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the difference isn't of massive magnitude at the center of the distribution.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, for example, women are less aggressive than men, which is, by the way, why they try to commit suicide more often,

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but are much less lethal in their actions.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's one example, but there are many examples.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you draw a random woman and a random man out of the population,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the probability that the man will be more aggressive is 60%.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you bet on the man, you'd win 60% of the time.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's not a walloping difference.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's not 95% of the time.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You know, it's a difference that is substantive.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's significant. It's measurable.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But it's not large by the standards by which such things are judged.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But that's not the point.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The point is that most of the activity takes place at the extremes.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So out on the tails of the distribution.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So here's an example.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
About 9 out of 10 people in prison are male.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why?

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Because to be in prison, you have to be the most aggressive person, let's say, in 100.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Those differences at the midpoint are large enough so that if you go out to the extremes,

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
1 in 100 people, you have an overwhelming preponderance of men.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And so you can have your cake and eat it too.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can say, well, yeah, broadly speaking, men and women are more the same than different.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The overlap is greater than the disjunction.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But that's not relevant if what's being selected is often at the extremes.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it often is.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, for example, with regards to engineering,

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
there's a fair bit of evidence that people who are more interested in things than in people become engineers.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, that's not really going to be, what is that, shocking?

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you shocked by that?

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You shouldn't be shocked by that, right?

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You can tell that not only by what engineers do, but you can tell that by how they think.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And you can tell that just by talking to them, if you know a bunch of engineers.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, and it turns out that the largest temperamental difference that's known between men and women

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is actually interest in people versus interest in things.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And so it has nothing to do with competence, but it has a lot to do with interest.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And because you have to be very interested in things to go be an engineer,

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
because that's all you're going to be doing if you're an engineer,

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
then only those people who are extremely interested in things tend to become engineers.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And most of them are men.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And that's why even in places like Scandinavia,

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
where a tremendous amount of effort has been put into flattening the sociocultural landscape,

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
successfully, by the way, there's still a preponderance of male engineers.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And there's a preponderance of female nurses.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And no matter how much sociological gerrymandering goes on,

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
those statistics have remained quite intractable over about a 15-year period.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And so there are differences.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There are differences.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
They're not massive.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And then you might ask, well, are those sociocultural or biological?

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's like, well, that's a hard question to answer because

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
it depends on how much variability there is in the sociocultural landscape

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
because the proportion by which something is biological versus sociocultural

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
varies with the sociocultural landscape.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's a complicated thing to digest because you think of those things as fixed, but they're not.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But what we have demonstrated quite clearly,

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and this is mainstream science despite the fact that people don't like it,

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
this test has already been done.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So we developed a personality model that's pretty stable across cultures,

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
purely derived from statistical processes,

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
an atheoretical model if there ever was one,

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and quite an unattractive model because of that conceptually.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But that's beside the point.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Then we saw cross-culturally whether there were differences

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
in the fundamental temperaments of men and women.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And the answer was yes, cross-culturally, quite robust.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Women are higher in the experience of anxiety and emotional pain,

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and they're more compassionate and agreeable.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Those are the big differences.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And they're differences of a magnitude that I already pointed out.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Then the next question is, well, to what degree is that biological versus sociocultural?

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And it's complicated because that variable depends on the sociocultural landscape,

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
but we'll put that aside.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You can determine that by stacking up countries

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
from those who have done everything they possibly can

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to flatten out the sociocultural landscape in relationship to gender

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to those who haven't, that are still very stratified by sex.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And then what you do is you look at the magnitude of the temperament differences

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
in keeping with the variability that those countries have

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
in terms of their sociocultural egalitarianism.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And the sociocultural types, the social constructionists,

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
their prediction is as cultures become more egalitarian,

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
men and women become more different, more the same.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Sorry, more the same, because it's environmental.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That isn't what happens.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Exactly the opposite happens.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
As you flatten out the sociocultural landscape,

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
men and women become more different.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The data is in.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The experiment is done.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Tens of thousands of people, multiple countries.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And it's not what anyone expected.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And you might think, well, it's all the right-wing psychologists.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like all the right-wing psychologists are in this room,

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:41,000
sitting in this chair.
